RecipeBook

RecipeBook is a hobby project—a personal web application I built to manage and explore recipes. It’s designed to showcase full-stack development skills, with a React frontend and a .NET Web API backend. Users can create, edit, and view recipes with details such as ingredients, instructions, images, and YouTube videos.

Key highlights:
Dynamic forms for adding/removing ingredients
Image upload with instant preview
Responsive UI built with Bootstrap
Authentication and user management using Microsoft Identity
CRUD operations integrated with a database via Entity Framework Core
